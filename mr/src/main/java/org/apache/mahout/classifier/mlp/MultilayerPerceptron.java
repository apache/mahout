/**
 * A Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is a kind of feed-forward artificial neural
 * network, which is a mathematical model inspired by the biological neural
 * network. The Multilayer Perceptron can be used for various machine learning
 * tasks such as classification and regression.
 * 
 * A detailed introduction about MLP can be found at
 * http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/Neural_Networks.
 * 
 * For this particular implementation, the users can freely control the topology
 * of the MLP, including: 1. The size of the input layer; 2. The number of
 * hidden layers; 3. The size of each hidden layer; 4. The size of the output
 * layer. 5. The cost function. 6. The squashing function.
 * 
 * The model is trained in an online learning approach, where the weights of
 * neurons in the MLP is updated incremented using backPropagation algorithm
 * proposed by (Rumelhart, D. E., Hinton, G. E., and Williams, R. J. (1986)
 * Learning representations by back-propagating errors. Nature, 323, 533--536.)
