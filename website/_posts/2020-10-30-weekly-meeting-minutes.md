### Topic: Apache Mahout Wikipedia Page

Trevor has been doing some serious overhauling on the Apache Mahout entry on Wikipedia.

However, he'd appreciate it if people could fill out sections, especially if they have expertise. 

Further- we would like to add architecture diagrams- both the original and the one with the
native solver- need to ask what the copyright it on those/if we can use them.

### Topic: Zeppelin Docker Image

The Apache Zeppelin+Mahout docker image is live- you can get started with Mahout now by following the instructions
[here](http://mahout.apache.org/docs/latest/tutorials/misc/getting-started-with-zeppelin/)

### Topic: Starting on Python Bindings

Trevor is going to start working on Python bindings. He thinks adding Mahout as a library for pyspark 
will significantly increase adoption. If anyone has experience using py4j or is otherwise interested in 
helping or wants to give words of encouragement reach out on dev or email him directly.
