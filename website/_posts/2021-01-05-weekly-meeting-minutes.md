Andrew showed Trevor how to file his first board report.

Springer Publishing has shown interest in a second edition of the Encyclopedia of Big Data, and Musselman plans to update
the chapter on Mahout.

Trevor needs to make a git repo to share with his experiments of Python+Mahout.

Reminder- community calls are open to all. We'll try to get a good link and post it to one of the minutes. In the mean
time join dev@mahout.apache.org for the weekly link.
