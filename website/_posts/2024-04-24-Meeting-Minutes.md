## Weekly community meeting
[Subscribe](mailto:user-subscribe@mahout.apache.org) to the Mahout User list to ask for details on joining.

### Attendees
* Tommy Naugle
* Trevor Grant


All old and new business was pushed to next meeting due to lack of quorum. 

Tommy and Trevor jointly reviewed [PR #442](https://github.com/apache/mahout/pull/442). 
The tl;dr is that it will be merged following some clean up on the git log. (Trevor walked Tommy through a chatGPT he made about how to clean it up).

Don't forget the Community Happy Hour on Monday 4/29! (Ask for link on user@m.a.o or the #mahout channel on the-asf.slack.com, all are welcome!)
