Hey all!  We're preparing for Mahout version 0.14.1.

This release might not seem super exciting from a user perspective (except 
we're bumping Apache Spark to version 2.x and Scala to version 2.11) but
it includes some very important 'behind the scenes changes'.  We're doing a 
heavy refactoring which will combine `math` and `math-scala` into a module 
called `core` (no change to code required!).

We will be moving H2o and Flink-batch engines into `community` that is to 
say the code will still be available, but we won't be actively maintaining 
it (we will accept PRs though).  We're moving the Map Reduce code to community
and have considered to once again accepting PRs against this code (if you have
an open PR, we'll hit you up after the release about rebasing and considering to
resubmit the PR)

We're going to be updating the Java dependency from 1.7 to 1.8. 

There was a LOT of old junk in the POMs which we have clipped out.

Stay tuned and [feel free to help out](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=80&projectKey=MAHOUT&view=detail&selectedIssue=MAHOUT-2047)!
