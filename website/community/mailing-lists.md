# General

Communication at Mahout happens primarily online via mailing lists. We have
a user as well as a dev list for discussion. In addition, there is a commit
list so we are able to monitor what happens in the GitHub repository.

# Mailing lists

## How to subscribe/unsubscribe

Follow the links below, or send mail manually, with empty subject and body.
The pattern for subscribing and unsubscribing to mailing lists at the ASF is
`<list-name>-<action>@<project>.apache.org`.

## Mahout User List

This list is for users of Mahout to ask questions, share knowledge, and
discuss issues. Do send mail to this list with usage and configuration
questions and problems. Also, please send questions to this list to verify
your problem before filing issues on GitHub.

## Mahout Developer List

This is the list where participating developers of the Mahout project meet
and discuss issues concerning Mahout internals, code changes/additions,
etc. Do not send mail to this list with usage questions or configuration
questions and problems.

# Slack

Most discussions now happen on the mailing lists and via GitHub issues and
discussions. It is a logged channel. Please keep in mind that it is for
discussion purposes only and that (pseudo)decisions should be brought back
to the dev@ mailing list or GitHub issues and discussions, and other people
who are not on Slack should be given time to respond before any work is
committed.

# IRC

Mahout's IRC channel is **#mahout**. Note that real-time project discussions
primarily take place on Slack now (see the Slack section above).

# Archives

## Official Apache Archive
