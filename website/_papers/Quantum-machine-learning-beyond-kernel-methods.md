This article presents a study on quantum machine learning models and their
comparison to classical models. The authors propose a framework that captures
all standard models based on parametrized quantum circuits, focusing on linear
quantum models. They analyze the resource requirements and learning performance
guarantees of these models, particularly comparing explicit and implicit models.
They show that implicit models can achieve a lower training loss but may suffer
from poor generalization performance. They also show that data re-uploading
models, a type of explicit model, can be more general than both explicit and
implicit models. The authors further investigate the advantages of explicit
models by testing their performance on a learning task involving
quantum-generated data. They find that explicit models can outperform both
implicit models and classical models on this task, highlighting the potential
learning advantage of explicit quantum models. The study provides insights into
the capabilities and limitations of different quantum machine learning models,
and it contributes to understanding the possible advantages of quantum models in
practical applications.
