title: Qumat - Quantum Computing with Mahout
---

# Qumat

Qumat is a high-level Python library for quantum computing that provides:

- **Quantum Circuit Abstraction** - Build quantum circuits with standard gates (Hadamard, CNOT, Pauli, etc.) and run them on Qiskit, Cirq, or Amazon Braket with a single unified API. Write once, execute anywhere.

- **QDP (Quantum Data Plane)** - Encode classical data into quantum states using GPU-accelerated kernels. Zero-copy tensor transfer via DLPack lets you move data between PyTorch, NumPy, and TensorFlow without overhead.
