Apache Mahout(TM) is a <strong>distributed linear algebra framework</strong> and <strong>mathematically expressive Scala DSL</strong> designed to let mathematicians, statisticians, and data scientists quickly <em>implementent their own algorithms</em>. Apache Spark is the reccomended out-of-the-box distributed back-end, <em>or can be extended to other distributed backends.</em>

- Mathematically Expressive Scala DSL
- Support for Multiple Distributed Backends (including Apache Spark)
- Modular Native Solvers for CPU/GPU/CUDA Acceleration
