# Mahout Quick Start 

The quickest way to take Apache Mahout for a test drive is by downloading a Docker container which contains Apache 
Zeppelin and is pre-loaded with a Spark-based, Mahout interpreter.

See the instructions [here](http://mahout.apache.org/docs/latest/tutorials/misc/getting-started-with-zeppelin/).

## Features

For a full list of Mahout's features see our [Features by Engine](http://mahout.apache.org/users/basics/algorithms.html) page.

    
## Using Mahout

Mahout has prepared a bunch of examples and tutorials for users to quickly learn how to use its machine learning algorithms.

#### Recommendations

Check the [Recommender Quickstart](/users/recommender/quickstart.html) or the tutorial on [creating a userbased recommender in 5 minutes](/users/recommender/userbased-5-minutes.html).

If you are building a recommender system for the first time, please also refer to a list of [Dos and Don'ts](/users/recommender/recommender-first-timer-faq.html) that might be helpful.

#### Clustering

Check the [Synthetic data](/users/clustering/clustering-of-synthetic-control-data.html) example.

#### Classification

If you are interested in how to train a **Naive Bayes** model, look at the [20 newsgroups](/users/classification/twenty-newsgroups.html) example.

If you plan to build a **Hidden Markov Model** for speech recognition, the example [here](/users/classification/hidden-markov-models.html) might be instructive. 

Or you could build a **Random Forest** model by following this [quick start page](/users/classification/partial-implementation.html).

#### Working with Text 

If you need to convert raw text into word vectors as input to clustering or classification algorithms, please refer to this page on [how to create vectors from text](/users/basics/creating-vectors-from-text.html).
