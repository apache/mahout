<p>As Mahout matures, solid testing procedures are needed.  This page and its
children capture test plans along with ideas for improving our testing.</p>

  <li>Test Plans for the 0.6 release
There are no special plans except for unit tests, and user testing of the
Hadoop jobs.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Algorithmic quality and speed are not tested, except in a few instances.
Such tests often require much longer run times (minutes to hours), a
running Hadoop cluster, and downloads of large datasets (in the megabytes).</li>
  <li>Standardized speed tests are difficult on different hardware.</li>
  <li>Unit tests of external integrations require access to externals: HDFS,
S3, JDBC, Cassandra, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Apache Jenkins is not able to support these environments. Commercial
donations would help.</p>

<p><a name="Testing-UnitTests"></a></p>
<h2 id="unit-tests">Unit Tests</h2>
<p>Mahout’s current tests are almost entirely unit tests. Algorithm tests
generally supply a few numbers to code paths and verify that expected
numbers come out. ‘mvn test’ runs these tests. There is “positive” coverage
of a great many utilities and algorithms. A much smaller percent include
“negative” coverage (bogus setups, inputs, combinations).</p>
