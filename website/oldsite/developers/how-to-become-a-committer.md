# How to become a committer

While there's no exact criteria for becoming a committer, there is a fairly
obvious path to becoming a committer.

For starters, one should be familiar with the [Apache Way ](http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html), especially the part about meritocracy.

Second, participate in the mailing lists, help answer questions when you
can and do so in a respectful manner.  This is often more important than
writing amazing code.

Third, write code, add patches, stick with them and be patient.  Add unit
tests and documentation.  In general, tackling 3 or 4 decent patches is
where the bar is at, but it depends on the state of the project.  In the
earlier stages of the project, the bar is a bit lower, so it pays to join
early!

Finally, it is then up to someone to nominate them to the PMC.	Typically,
one of the existing committers does this by sending an email to the private
PMC mailing list (private@m.a.o, where m.a.o is mahout.apache.org) and then
the PMC votes on it.  Nominations often occur internal to the PMC as well.
