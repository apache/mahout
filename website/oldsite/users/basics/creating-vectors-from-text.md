# Creating vectors from text
<a name="CreatingVectorsfromText-Introduction"></a>
# Introduction

For clustering and classifying documents it is usually necessary to convert the raw text
into vectors that can then be consumed by the clustering [Algorithms](algorithms.html).  These approaches are described below.

<a name="CreatingVectorsfromText-FromLucene"></a>
# From Lucene

*NOTE: Your Lucene index must be created with the same version of Lucene
used in Mahout.  As of Mahout 0.9 this is Lucene 4.6.1. If these versions dont match you will likely get "Exception in thread "main"
org.apache.lucene.index.CorruptIndexException: Unknown format version: -11"
as an error.*

Mahout has utilities that allow one to easily produce Mahout Vector
representations from a Lucene (and Solr, since they are they same) index.

For this, we assume you know how to build a Lucene/Solr index.	For those
who don't, it is probably easiest to get up and running using [Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr)
 as it can ingest things like PDFs, XML, Office, etc. and create a Lucene
index.	For those wanting to use just Lucene, see the [Lucene website](http://lucene.apache.org/core)
 or check out _Lucene In Action_ by Erik Hatcher, Otis Gospodnetic and Mike
McCandless.

To get started, make sure you get a fresh copy of Mahout from [GitHub](http://mahout.apache.org/developers/buildingmahout.html)
 and are comfortable building it. It defines interfaces and implementations
for efficiently iterating over a data source (it only supports Lucene
currently, but should be extensible to databases, Solr, etc.) and produces
a Mahout Vector file and term dictionary which can then be used for
clustering.   The main code for driving this is the driver program located
in the org.apache.mahout.utils.vectors package.  The driver program offers
several input options, which can be displayed by specifying the --help
option.  Examples of running the driver are included below:

                                               null, then the Lucene     
                                               internal doc id is used   
                                               which is prone to error   
                                               if the underlying index   
                                               changes

                                               not specified, then it    
                                               will loop over all docs   
        --dictOut (-t) dictOut             The output of the

                                               used to remove really     
                                               high frequency terms.

                                               between 0 and 100.        
                                               Default is 99.

                                               term vector. These are    
                                               noise document and can    
                                               occur if the analyzer     
                                               used strips out all terms 
                                               in the target field. This

                                               1. The default is 0.  
  
#### Example: Create 50 Vectors from an Index 

    $MAHOUT_HOME/bin/mahout lucene.vector
        --dir $WORK_DIR/wikipedia/solr/data/index 
        --field body 
        --dictOut $WORK_DIR/solr/wikipedia/dict.txt
        --output $WORK_DIR/solr/wikipedia/out.txt 
        --max 50


This uses the index specified by --dir and the body field in it and writes
out the info to the output dir and the dictionary to dict.txt.	It only
outputs 50 vectors.  If you don't specify --max, then all the documents in
the index are output.

#### Example: Creating 50 Normalized Vectors from a Lucene Index using the [L_2 Norm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lp_space)

    $MAHOUT_HOME/bin/mahout lucene.vector 
        --dir $WORK_DIR/wikipedia/solr/data/index 
        --field body 
        --dictOut $WORK_DIR/solr/wikipedia/dict.txt
        --output $WORK_DIR/solr/wikipedia/out.txt 
        --max 50 
        --norm 2

## From A Directory of Text documents
Mahout has utilities to generate Vectors from a directory of text
documents. Before creating the vectors, you need to convert the documents
to SequenceFile format. SequenceFile is a hadoop class which allows us to
write arbitary (key, value) pairs into it. The DocumentVectorizer requires the
key to be a Text with a unique document id, and value to be the Text
content in UTF-8 format.

You may find [Tika](http://tika.apache.org/) helpful in converting
binary documents to text.

#### Converting directory of documents to SequenceFile format
Mahout has a nifty utility which reads a directory path including its
sub-directories and creates the SequenceFile in a chunked manner for us.

        --keyPrefix (-prefix) keyPrefix          The prefix to be prepended to  
                                                     the key

This will create SequenceFiles of tokenized documents < Text, StringTuple >  (docID, tokenizedDoc) and vectorized documents < Text, VectorWritable > (docID, TF-IDF Vector).  

As well, seq2sparse will create SequenceFiles for: a dictionary (wordIndex, word), a word frequency count (wordIndex, count) and a document frequency count (wordIndex, DFCount) in the output directory. 

The --minSupport option is the min frequency for the word to be considered as a feature; --minDF is the min number of documents the word needs to be in; --maxDFPercent is the max value of the expression (document frequency of a word/total number of document) to be considered as good feature to be in the document. These options are helpful in removing high frequency features like stop words.

The vectorized documents can then be used as input to many of Mahout's classification and clustering algorithms.

#### Example: Creating Normalized [TF-IDF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) Vectors from a directory of text documents using [trigrams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram) and the [L_2 Norm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lp_space)
Create sequence files from the directory of text documents:
    
    $MAHOUT_HOME/bin/mahout seqdirectory 
        -i $WORK_DIR/reuters 
        -o $WORK_DIR/reuters-seqdir 
        -c UTF-8
        -chunk 64
        -xm sequential

Vectorize the documents using trigrams, L_2 length normalization and a maximum document frequency cutoff of 85%.

    $MAHOUT_HOME/bin/mahout seq2sparse 
        -i $WORK_DIR/reuters-out-seqdir/ 
        -o $WORK_DIR/reuters-out-seqdir-sparse-kmeans 
        --namedVec
        -wt tfidf
        -ng 3
        -n 2
        --maxDFPercent 85 

The sequence file in the $WORK_DIR/reuters-out-seqdir-sparse-kmeans/tfidf-vectors directory can now be used as input to the Mahout [k-Means](http://mahout.apache.org/users/clustering/k-means-clustering.html) clustering algorithm.

## Converting existing vectors to Mahout's format

If you are in the happy position to already own a document (as in: texts,
images or whatever item you wish to treat) processing pipeline, the
question arises of how to convert the vectors into the Mahout vector
format. Probably the easiest way to go would be to implement your own
Iterable<Vector> (called VectorIterable in the example below) and then
reuse the existing VectorWriter classes:


    VectorWriter vectorWriter = SequenceFile.createWriter(filesystem,
                                                          configuration,
                                                          outfile,
                                                          LongWritable.class,
                                                          SparseVector.class);

    long numDocs = vectorWriter.write(new VectorIterable(), Long.MAX_VALUE);
