## Enforcement Guidelines

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, maintainers and community leaders may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including temporary bans or permanent expulsion from the community without warning.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness any violations of this Code of Conduct, please contact the project maintainers or raise the issue on the community mailing list. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
