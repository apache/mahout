## How do I edit Mahouts website? Jekyll

The Mahout website uses Jekyll to manage its website.  Refer to this page to setup your laptop with jekyll if you want to setup a local environment.

Once you have Jekyll installed, next you will need to clone the mahout git repo
```
git clone https://github.com/apache/mahout.git mahout
cd website
```

## Getting Started

To start editing the website first you need to open two terminals.  One terminal will run a continuous build of the mahout website locally, and the other will serve the website on localhost:4000

Terminal 1
```
jekyll serve
```

Terminal 2
```
jekyll build --watch
```

Browser
```
localhost:4000
```

Start coding.
