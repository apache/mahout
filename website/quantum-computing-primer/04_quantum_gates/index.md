# 4. Quantum Gates

Quantum gates are the building blocks of quantum circuits, analogous to classical logic gates in classical computing. They manipulate qubits, enabling the creation of complex quantum algorithms. In this section, we will explore the different types of quantum gates and how to apply them using the `qumat` library.

## 4.1 Single-Qubit Gates

Single-qubit gates operate on a single qubit, changing its state. Some of the most common single-qubit gates include:

- **Pauli-X Gate**: Similar to the classical NOT gate, it flips the state of a qubit.
- **Pauli-Y Gate**: Introduces a phase flip and a bit flip.
- **Pauli-Z Gate**: Introduces a phase flip without changing the bit value.
- **Hadamard Gate**: Creates superposition by transforming the basis states.
- **Rotation Gates (Rx, Ry, Rz)**: Rotate the qubit state around the X, Y, or Z axis of the Bloch sphere.

### Example: Applying a Hadamard Gate
```python
from qumat import QuMat

# Initialize the quantum circuit with 1 qubit
backend_config = {'backend_name': 'qiskit', 'backend_options': {'simulator_type': 'qasm_simulator', 'shots': 1000}}
qc = QuMat(backend_config)
qc.create_empty_circuit(1)

# Apply the Hadamard gate to the first qubit
qc.apply_hadamard_gate(0)

# Execute the circuit and print the results
result = qc.execute_circuit()
print(result)
```

## 4.2 Multi-Qubit Gates

Multi-qubit gates operate on two or more qubits, enabling entanglement and more
complex quantum operations. Some of the most common multi-qubit gates include:

- **CNOT Gate (Controlled-NOT)**: Flips the target qubit if the control qubit is
in the state $|1\rangle$.
- **Toffoli Gate (CCNOT)**: A controlled-controlled-NOT gate that flips the
target qubit if both control qubits are in the state $|1\rangle$.
- **SWAP Gate**: Exchanges the states of two qubits.

### Example: Applying a CNOT Gate
```python
# Initialize the quantum circuit with 2 qubits
qc.create_empty_circuit(2)

# Apply the Hadamard gate to the first qubit
qc.apply_hadamard_gate(0)

# Apply the CNOT gate with qubit 0 as control and qubit 1 as target
qc.apply_cnot_gate(0, 1)

# Execute the circuit and print the results
result = qc.execute_circuit()
print(result)
```

## 4.3 Applying Gates with `qumat`

The `qumat` library provides a simple and consistent interface for applying quantum gates. Below are some examples of how to apply different gates using `qumat`.

### Example: Applying Rotation Gates
```python
# Initialize the quantum circuit with 1 qubit
qc.create_empty_circuit(1)

# Apply an Rx gate with a rotation angle of π/2
qc.apply_rx_gate(0, 3.14159 / 2)

# Apply an Ry gate with a rotation angle of π/4
qc.apply_ry_gate(0, 3.14159 / 4)

# Apply an Rz gate with a rotation angle of π
qc.apply_rz_gate(0, 3.14159)

# Execute the circuit and print the results
result = qc.execute_circuit()
print(result)
```

### Example: Applying a Toffoli Gate
```python
# Initialize the quantum circuit with 3 qubits
qc.create_empty_circuit(3)

# Apply the Hadamard gate to the first two qubits
qc.apply_hadamard_gate(0)
qc.apply_hadamard_gate(1)

# Apply the Toffoli gate with qubits 0 and 1 as controls and qubit 2 as target
qc.apply_toffoli_gate(0, 1, 2)

# Execute the circuit and print the results
result = qc.execute_circuit()
print(result)
```

### Example: Applying a SWAP Gate
```python
# Initialize the quantum circuit with 2 qubits
qc.create_empty_circuit(2)

# Apply the Hadamard gate to the first qubit
qc.apply_hadamard_gate(0)

# Apply the SWAP gate to exchange the states of qubits 0 and 1
qc.apply_swap_gate(0, 1)

# Execute the circuit and print the results
result = qc.execute_circuit()
print(result)
```

## 4.4 Visualizing Quantum Circuits

Visualizing quantum circuits can help in understanding the flow of quantum operations. The `qumat` library provides a simple way to draw circuits.

### Example: Drawing a Quantum Circuit
```python
# Initialize the quantum circuit with 2 qubits
qc.create_empty_circuit(2)

# Apply a Hadamard gate to the first qubit
qc.apply_hadamard_gate(0)

# Apply a CNOT gate with qubit 0 as control and qubit 1 as target
qc.apply_cnot_gate(0, 1)

# Draw the circuit
qc.draw()
```

This section introduced the fundamental quantum gates and demonstrated how to apply them using the `qumat` library. In the next section, we will explore how to build more complex quantum circuits by combining these gates.
