## Overview

Apache Mahout is an open-source framework designed for creating scalable machine learning algorithms and distributed linear algebra operations. Originally built on top of Hadoop’s MapReduce framework, Mahout has evolved into a mathematically expressive environment for building high-performance machine learning systems.  

Today, Mahout leverages distributed computing engines such as **Apache Spark**, **Apache Flink**, and **H2O** through its **Samsara DSL** — a powerful domain-specific language for matrix and vector mathematics. This shift allows Mahout to support large-scale data processing and advanced analytical workloads while maintaining concise mathematical syntax.

## Purpose of This Page

This section curates research papers, academic studies, and technical references that align with Mahout’s objectives — from **distributed linear algebra** and **matrix factorization** to **recommendation systems**, **clustering**, and **scalable machine learning algorithms**.  

Each paper summarized here provides theoretical or practical insights into the technologies that influence Mahout’s ongoing development and implementation.

## Topics Covered

The listed works and references generally relate to:

- **Distributed Linear Algebra and Matrix Computations**  
  Techniques that power Mahout’s core algebra engine for scalable data processing.  

- **Recommender Systems and Collaborative Filtering**  
  Foundational research behind Mahout’s recommendation algorithms.  

- **Clustering and Classification Methods**  
  Studies on scalable implementations of k-Means, Naive Bayes, and other algorithms.  

- **Scalable Machine Learning Frameworks**  
  Research on distributed computing paradigms that inspired Mahout’s move from MapReduce to Samsara.
