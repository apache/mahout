# General

Communication at Mahout happens primarily online via mailing lists. We have
a user as well as a dev list for discussion. In addition there is a commit
list so we are able to monitor what happens on the wiki and in svn.

# IRC

Mahout's IRC channel is **#mahout**.  It is a logged channel.  Please keep in
mind that it is for discussion purposes only and that (pseudo)decisions
should be brought back to the dev@ mailing list or JIRA and other people
who are not on IRC should be given time to respond before any work is
committed.
