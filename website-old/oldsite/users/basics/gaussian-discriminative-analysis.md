# Gaussian Discriminative Analysis

Gaussian Discriminative Analysis is a tool for multigroup classification
based on extending linear discriminant analysis. The paper on the approach
is located at http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/4617.html (note, for some reason
the paper is backwards, in that page 1 is at the end)
