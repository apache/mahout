{excerpt}Is a weight measure often used in information retrieval and text
mining. This weight is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important
a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. The importance increases
proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document but is
offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus.{excerpt} In other words
if a term/word appears lots in a document but also appears lots in the
corpus/collection as a whole it will get a lower score. An example of this
would be "the", "and", "it" but depending on your source material it maybe
other words that are very common to the source matter.
