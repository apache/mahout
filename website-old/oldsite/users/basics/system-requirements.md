# System Requirements

* Java 1.6.x or greater.
* Maven 3.x to build the source code.

CPU, Disk and Memory requirements are based on the many choices made in
implementing your application with Mahout (document size, number of
documents, and number of hits retrieved to name a few.)

Several of the Mahout algorithms are implemented to work on Hadoop
clusters. If not advertised differently, those implementations work with
Hadoop 0.20.0 or greater.
