### Original Apache Mahout Site

Currently running with `mahout3` theme.  To switch to old theme:
    
     rake theme:switch name="mahout-retro"
     
Also if you want to be fun, you can use the `mahout-retro` theme on the other website parts as well.


To build come to this directory and type

    jekyll serve
