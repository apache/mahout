## Overview

_This documentation concerns the non-distributed, non-Hadoop-based
recommender engine / collaborative filtering code inside Mahout. It was
formerly a separate project called "Taste" and has continued development
inside Mahout alongside other Hadoop-based code. It may be viewed as a
somewhat separate, more comprehensive and more mature aspect of this
code, compared to current development efforts focusing on Hadoop-based
distributed recommenders. This remains the best entry point into Mahout
recommender engines of all kinds._

A Mahout-based collaborative filtering engine takes users' preferences for
items ("tastes") and returns estimated preferences for other items. For
example, a site that sells books or CDs could easily use Mahout to figure
out, from past purchase data, which CDs a customer might be interested in
listening to.

Mahout provides a rich set of components from which you can construct a
customized recommender system from a selection of algorithms. Mahout is
designed to be enterprise-ready; it's designed for performance, scalability
and flexibility.

Top-level packages define the Mahout interfaces to these key abstractions:

* **DataModel**
* **UserSimilarity**
* **ItemSimilarity**
* **UserNeighborhood**
* **Recommender**

Subpackages of *org.apache.mahout.cf.taste.impl* hold implementations of
these interfaces. These are the pieces from which you will build your own
recommendation engine. That's it!

## Architecture

![doc](../../images/taste-architecture.png)

This diagram shows the relationship between various Mahout components in a
user-based recommender. An item-based recommender system is similar except
that there are no Neighborhood algorithms involved.

<a name="RecommenderDocumentation-Recommender"></a>
### Recommender
A Recommender is the core abstraction in Mahout. Given a DataModel, it can
produce recommendations. Applications will most likely use the
**GenericUserBasedRecommender** or **GenericItemBasedRecommender**,
possibly decorated by **CachingRecommender**.

<a name="RecommenderDocumentation-DataModel"></a>
### DataModel
A **DataModel** is the interface to information about user preferences. An
implementation might draw this data from any source, but a database is the
most likely source. Be sure to wrap this with a **ReloadFromJDBCDataModel** to get good performance! Mahout provides **MySQLJDBCDataModel**, for example, to access preference data from a database via JDBC and MySQL. Another exists for PostgreSQL. Mahout also provides a **FileDataModel**, which is fine for small applications.

Users and items are identified solely by an ID value in the
framework. Further, this ID value must be numeric; it is a Java long type
through the APIs. A **Preference** object or **PreferenceArray** object
encapsulates the relation between user and preferred items (or items and
users preferring them).

Finally, Mahout supports, in various ways, a so-called "boolean" data model
in which users do not express preferences of varying strengths for items,
but simply express an association or none at all. For example, while users
might express a preference from 1 to 5 in the context of a movie
recommender site, there may be no notion of a preference value between
users and pages in the context of recommending pages on a web site: there
is only a notion of an association, or none, between a user and pages that
have been visited.

<a name="RecommenderDocumentation-UserSimilarity"></a>
### UserSimilarity
A **UserSimilarity** defines a notion of similarity between two users. This is
a crucial part of a recommendation engine. These are attached to a
**Neighborhood** implementation. **ItemSimilarity** is analagous, but find
similarity between items.

<a name="RecommenderDocumentation-UserNeighborhood"></a>
### UserNeighborhood
In a user-based recommender, recommendations are produced by finding a
"neighborhood" of similar users near a given user. A **UserNeighborhood**
defines a means of determining that neighborhood &mdash; for example,
nearest 10 users. Implementations typically need a **UserSimilarity** to
operate.

<a name="RecommenderDocumentation-Examples"></a>
## Examples
<a name="RecommenderDocumentation-User-basedRecommender"></a>
### User-based Recommender
User-based recommenders are the "original", conventional style of
recommender systems. They can produce good recommendations when tweaked
properly; they are not necessarily the fastest recommender systems and are
thus suitable for small data sets (roughly, less than ten million ratings).
We'll start with an example of this.

First, create a **DataModel** of some kind. Here, we'll use a simple on based
on data in a file. The file should be in CSV format, with lines of the form
"userID,itemID,prefValue" (e.g. "39505,290002,3.5"):


    DataModel model = new FileDataModel(new File("data.txt"));


We'll use the **PearsonCorrelationSimilarity** implementation of **UserSimilarity**
as our user correlation algorithm, and add an optional preference inference
algorithm:


    UserSimilarity userSimilarity = new PearsonCorrelationSimilarity(model);


Now we create a **UserNeighborhood** algorithm. Here we use nearest-3:


    UserNeighborhood neighborhood =
    	  new NearestNUserNeighborhood(3, userSimilarity, model);{code}
    
Now we can create our **Recommender**, and add a caching decorator:
    

    Recommender recommender =
	  new GenericUserBasedRecommender(model, neighborhood, userSimilarity);
    Recommender cachingRecommender = new CachingRecommender(recommender);

    
Now we can get 10 recommendations for user ID "1234" &mdash; done!

    List<RecommendedItem> recommendations =
	  cachingRecommender.recommend(1234, 10);

    
## Item-based Recommender
    
We could have created an item-based recommender instead. Item-based
recommenders base recommendation not on user similarity, but on item
similarity. In theory these are about the same approach to the problem,
just from different angles. However the similarity of two items is
relatively fixed, more so than the similarity of two users. So, item-based
recommenders can use pre-computed similarity values in the computations,
which make them much faster. For large data sets, item-based recommenders
are more appropriate.
    
Let's start over, again with a **FileDataModel** to start:
    

    DataModel model = new FileDataModel(new File("data.txt"));

    
We'll also need an **ItemSimilarity**. We could use
**PearsonCorrelationSimilarity**, which computes item similarity in realtime,
but, this is generally too slow to be useful. Instead, in a real
application, you would feed a list of pre-computed correlations to a
**GenericItemSimilarity**: 
    

    // Construct the list of pre-computed correlations
    Collection<GenericItemSimilarity.ItemItemSimilarity> correlations =
	  ...;
    ItemSimilarity itemSimilarity =
	  new GenericItemSimilarity(correlations);


    
Then we can finish as before to produce recommendations:
    

    Recommender recommender =
	  new GenericItemBasedRecommender(model, itemSimilarity);
    Recommender cachingRecommender = new CachingRecommender(recommender);
    ...
    List<RecommendedItem> recommendations =
	  cachingRecommender.recommend(1234, 10);

## Integration with your application

You can create a Recommender, as shown above, wherever you like in your
Java application, and use it. This includes simple Java applications or GUI
applications, server applications, and J2EE web applications.

## Performance
<a name="RecommenderDocumentation-RuntimePerformance"></a>
### Runtime Performance
The more data you give, the better. Though Mahout is designed for
performance, you will undoubtedly run into performance issues at some
point. For best results, consider using the following command-line flags to
your JVM:

* -server: Enables the server VM, which is generally appropriate for
long-running, computation-intensive applications.
* -Xms1024m -Xmx1024m: Make the heap as big as possible -- a gigabyte
doesn't hurt when dealing with tens millions of preferences. Mahout
recommenders will generally use as much memory as you give it for caching,
which helps performance. Set the initial and max size to the same value to
avoid wasting time growing the heap, and to avoid having the JVM run minor
collections to avoid growing the heap, which will clear cached values.
* -da -dsa: Disable all assertions.
* -XX:NewRatio=9: Increase heap allocated to 'old' objects, which is most
of them in this framework
* -XX:+UseParallelGC -XX:+UseParallelOldGC (multi-processor machines only):
Use a GC algorithm designed to take advantage of multiple processors, and
designed for throughput. This is a default in J2SE 5.0.
* -XX:-DisableExplicitGC: Disable calls to System.gc(). These calls can
only hurt in the presence of modern GC algorithms; they may force Mahout to
remove cached data needlessly. This flag isn't needed if you're sure your
code and third-party code you use doesn't call this method.

Also consider the following tips:

* Use **CachingRecommender** on top of your custom **Recommender** implementation.
* When using **JDBCDataModel**, make sure you wrap it with the **ReloadFromJDBCDataModel** to load data into memory!. 

<a name="RecommenderDocumentation-AlgorithmPerformance:WhichOneIsBest?"></a>
### Algorithm Performance: Which One Is Best?
There is no right answer; it depends on your data, your application,
environment, and performance needs. Mahout provides the building blocks
from which you can construct the best Recommender for your application. The
links below provide research on this topic. You will probably need a bit of
trial-and-error to find a setup that works best. The code sample above
provides a good starting point.

Fortunately, Mahout provides a way to evaluate the accuracy of your
Recommender on your own data, in org.apache.mahout.cf.taste.eval


    DataModel myModel = ...;
    RecommenderBuilder builder = new RecommenderBuilder() {
      public Recommender buildRecommender(DataModel model) {
        // build and return the Recommender to evaluate here
      }
    };
    RecommenderEvaluator evaluator =
    	  new AverageAbsoluteDifferenceRecommenderEvaluator();
    double evaluation = evaluator.evaluate(builder, myModel, 0.9, 1.0);


For "boolean" data model situations, where there are no notions of
preference value, the above evaluation based on estimated preference does
not make sense. In this case, try a *RecommenderIRStatsEvaluator*, which presents
traditional information retrieval figures like precision and recall, which
are more meaningful.
