## Mahout-Samsara's In-Core Linear Algebra DSL Reference

#### Imports

The following imports are used to enable Mahout-Samsara's Scala DSL bindings for in-core Linear Algebra:

    import org.apache.mahout.math._
    import scalabindings._
    import RLikeOps._
    
#### Inline initalization

Dense vectors:

    val densVec1: Vector = (1.0, 1.1, 1.2)
    val denseVec2 = dvec(1, 0, 1,1 ,1,2)

Sparse vectors:

    val sparseVec1: Vector = (5 -> 1.0) :: (10 -> 2.0) :: Nil
    val sparseVec1 = svec((5 -> 1.0) :: (10 -> 2.0) :: Nil)

    // to create a vector with specific cardinality
    val sparseVec1 = svec((5 -> 1.0) :: (10 -> 2.0) :: Nil, cardinality = 20)
    
Inline matrix initialization, either sparse or dense, is always done row wise. 

Dense matrices:

    val A = dense((1, 2, 3), (3, 4, 5))
    
Sparse matrices:

    val A = sparse(
              (1, 3) :: Nil,
              (0, 2) :: (1, 2.5) :: Nil
                  )

Diagonal matrix with constant diagonal elements:

    diag(3.5, 10)

Diagonal matrix with main diagonal backed by a vector:

    diagv((1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
    
Identity matrix:

    eye(10)
    
####Slicing and Assigning

Getting a vector element:

    val d = vec(5)

Setting a vector element:
    
    vec(5) = 3.0
    
Getting a matrix element:

    val d = m(3,5)
    
Setting a matrix element:

    M(3,5) = 3.0
    
Getting a matrix row or column:

    val rowVec = M(3, ::)
    val colVec = M(::, 3)
    
Setting a matrix row or column via vector assignment:

    M(3, ::) := (1, 2, 3)
    M(::, 3) := (1, 2, 3)
    
Setting a subslices of a matrix row or column:

    a(0, 0 to 1) = (3, 5)
   
Setting a subslices of a matrix row or column via vector assignment:

    a(0, 0 to 1) := (3, 5)
   
Getting a matrix as from matrix contiguous block:

    val B = A(2 to 3, 3 to 4)
   
Assigning a contiguous block to a matrix:

    A(0 to 1, 1 to 2) = dense((3, 2), (3 ,3))
   
Assigning a contiguous block to a matrix using the matrix assignment operator:

    A(o to 1, 1 to 2) := dense((3, 2), (3, 3))
   
Assignment operator used for copying between vectors or matrices:

    vec1 := vec2
    M1 := M2
   
Assignment operator using assignment through a functional literal for a matrix:

    M := ((row, col, x) => if (row == col) 1 else 0
    
Assignment operator using assignment through a functional literal for a vector:

    vec := ((index, x) => sqrt(x)
    
#### BLAS-like operations

Plus/minus either vector or numeric with assignment or not:

    a + b
    a - b
    a + 5.0
    a - 5.0
    
Hadamard (elementwise) product, either vector or matrix or numeric operands:

    a * b
    a * 0.5

Operations with assignment:

    a += b
    a -= b
    a += 5.0
    a -= 5.0
    a *= b
    a *= 5
   
*Some nuanced rules*: 

1/x in R (where x is a vector or a matrix) is elementwise inverse.  In scala it would be expressed as:

    val xInv = 1 /: x

and R's 5.0 - x would be:
   
    val x1 = 5.0 -: x
    
*note: All assignment operations, including :=, return the assignee just like in C++*:

    a -= b 
    
assigns **a - b** to **b** (in-place) and returns **b**.  Similarly for **a /=: b** or **1 /=: v** 
    

Dot product:

    a dot b
    
Matrix and vector equivalency (or non-equivalency).  **Dangerous, exact equivalence is rarely useful, better to use norm comparisons with an allowance of small errors.**
    
    a === b
    a !== b
    
Matrix multiply:    

    a %*% b
    
Optimized Right Multiply with a diagonal matrix: 

    diag(5, 5) :%*% b
   
Optimized Left Multiply with a diagonal matrix:

    A %*%: diag(5, 5)

Second norm, of a vector or matrix:

    a.norm
    
Transpose:

    val Mt = M.t
    
*note: Transposition is currently handled via view, i.e. updating a transposed matrix will be updating the original.*  Also computing something like `\(\mathbf{X^\top}\mathbf{X}\)`:

    val XtX = X.t %*% X
    
will not therefore incur any additional data copying.

#### Decompositions

Matrix decompositions require an additional import:

    import org.apache.mahout.math.decompositions._


All arguments in the following are matricies.

**Cholesky decomposition**

    val ch = chol(M)
    
**SVD**

    val (U, V, s) = svd(M)
    
**EigenDecomposition**

    val (V, d) = eigen(M)
    
**QR decomposition**

    val (Q, R) = qr(M)
    
**Rank**: Check for rank deficiency (runs rank-revealing QR)

    M.isFullRank
   
**In-core SSVD**

    Val (U, V, s) = ssvd(A, k = 50, p = 15, q = 1)
    
**Solving linear equation systems and matrix inversion:** fully similar to R semantics; there are three forms of invocation:


Solve `\(\mathbf{AX}=\mathbf{B}\)`:

    solve(A, B)
   
Solve `\(\mathbf{Ax}=\mathbf{b}\)`:
  
    solve(A, b)
   
Compute `\(\mathbf{A^{-1}}\)`:

    solve(A)
   
#### Misc

Vector cardinality:

    a.length
    
Matrix cardinality:

    m.nrow
    m.ncol
    
Means and sums:

    m.colSums
    m.colMeans
    m.rowSums
    m.rowMeans
    
Copy-By-Value:

    val b = a cloned
    
#### Random Matrices

`\(\mathcal{U}\)`(0,1) random matrix view:

    val incCoreA = Matrices.uniformView(m, n, seed)

    
`\(\mathcal{U}\)`(-1,1) random matrix view:

    val incCoreA = Matrices.symmetricUniformView(m, n, seed)

`\(\mathcal{N}\)`(-1,1) random matrix view:

    val incCoreA = Matrices.gaussianView(m, n, seed)
    
#### Iterators 

Mahout-Math already exposes a number of iterators.  Scala code just needs the following imports to enable implicit conversions to scala iterators.

    import collection._
    import JavaConversions._
    
Iterating over rows in a Matrix:

    for (row <- m) {
      ... do something with row
    }
    
<!--Iterating over non-zero and all elements of a vector:
*Note that Vector.Element also has some implicit syntatic sugar, e.g to add 5.0 to every non-zero element of a matrix, the following code may be used:*

    for (row <- m; el <- row.nonZero) el = 5.0 + el
    ... or 
    for (row <- m; el <- row.nonZero) el := 5.0 + el
    
Similarly **row.all** produces an iterator over all elements in a row (Vector).
