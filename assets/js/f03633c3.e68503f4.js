The ansatz architecture is a crucial component of\nquantum computing and determines the efficiency and accuracy of quantum\nalgorithms. The authors conduct experiments using a series of application\nbenchmarks, including portfolio optimization, the MaxCut problem, the Traveling\nSalesman Problem (TSP), and the estimation of molecule ground state energy for\nLithium Hydride (LiH) and Water (H2O). They compare the performance of the\nansatz architectures generated by QGAS with existing ansatzes and\nstate-of-the-art ansatz architecture search methods. The results show that QGAS\noutperforms other ansatz architectures in some benchmark applications,\ndemonstrating the potential of LLMs in quantum architecture design. The authors\nhighlight the importance of human feedback in guiding the performance of GPT-4.\nHuman experts provide specific guidance and feedback to improve the search\nstrategies and evaluate the generated ansatz architectures. The iterative\nfeedback loop between human experts and GPT-4 leads to better performance and\noptimization of the quantum circuits. The paper also discusses the limitations\nof GPT in the field of quantum computing. GPT is not a general artificial\nintelligence and cannot think dynamically about quantum physics or make accurate\npredictions about scientific phenomena in quantum experiments. It also relies on\nlarge-scale data models, which may contain biased or misleading information\nabout quantum computing. The authors suggest future directions for the\nintegration of LLMs, such as GPT, in quantum computing. They propose that GPT\ncan be used to design and optimize fault-tolerant quantum algorithms and assist\nin the calibration of quantum hardware. They also envision GPT playing a role in\nthe simulation of quantum computers and providing agile validation of\nalgorithmic innovations. In conclusion, this paper highlights the potential of\nLLMs, specifically GPT, in the field of quantum computing. The QGAS model\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of using GPT-4 to generate high-performance\nansatz architectures for quantum algorithms. The integration of human feedback\nand the power of GPT-4 provides a promising avenue for advancing quantum\narchitecture design and optimization. However, the limitations of GPT and the\nchallenges of applying LLMs to quantum computing should be considered. The\nauthors suggest further research and development to leverage the capabilities of\nGPT and address the limitations to fully harness the potential of LLMs in\nquantum computing."})]})}function l(e={}){const{wrapper:n}={...(0,o.R)(),...e.components};return n?(0,i.jsx)(n,{...e,children:(0,i.jsx)(c,{...e})}):c(e)}},8453(e,n,t){t.d(n,{R:()=>r,x:()=>s});var a=t(6540);const i={},o=a.createContext(i);function r(e){const n=a.useContext(o);return a.useMemo(function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(n):{...n,...e}},[n,e])}function s(e){let n;return n=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(i):e.components||i:r(e.components),a.createElement(o.Provider,{value:n},e.children)}}}]);
