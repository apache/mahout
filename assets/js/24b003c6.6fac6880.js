The algorithm involves running a quantum circuit with\n\u02dcO(n3/2) gates for \u221an + 4 times, and then using a polynomial-time classical\npost-processing step. The correctness of the algorithm is based on a\nnumber-theoretic assumption similar to those used in subexponential classical\nfactorization algorithms. The author demonstrates that quantum circuits of size\n\u02dcO(n3/2) are sufficient for factoring integers, which is an improvement over\nprevious algorithms that required larger circuit sizes. The number of qubits in\nthe quantum circuit is O(n3/2), which is higher than the qubit requirement in\noptimized implementations of Shor's algorithm. However, the depth of the quantum\ncircuit is smaller than Shor's algorithm, making it more feasible for\nimplementation. The paper also discusses the potential implications of the\nalgorithm in practice. It is highlighted that the analysis is asymptotic and the\nalgorithm may not be efficient for small values of n. The algorithm may benefit\nfrom optimizations in fast integer multiplication and the use of smaller qubit\ncounts, similar to optimizations used in Shor's algorithm. However, it is\ncurrently unclear if these optimizations can be applied to the proposed\nalgorithm. The author concludes by stating that the algorithm provides an\nimprovement over Shor's algorithm in terms of circuit size. However, it remains\nto be seen if the algorithm can be practically implemented and if it can provide\nan improvement over Shor's algorithm for small values of n. The analysis in the\npaper is based on asymptotics, and it is unclear if hidden constants in the\nalgorithm would make it inefficient for small values of n. In summary, the paper\npresents an efficient quantum factoring algorithm that uses a quantum circuit\nwith \u02dcO(n3/2) gates and a classical post-processing step. The algorithm provides\nan improvement over previous algorithms in terms of circuit size, but its\npracticality and potential improvements for small values of n remain to be seen."})]})}function u(t={}){const{wrapper:e}={...(0,r.R)(),...t.components};return e?(0,a.jsx)(e,{...t,children:(0,a.jsx)(l,{...t})}):l(t)}},8453(t,e,i){i.d(e,{R:()=>o,x:()=>s});var n=i(6540);const a={},r=n.createContext(a);function o(t){const e=n.useContext(r);return n.useMemo(function(){return"function"==typeof t?t(e):{...e,...t}},[e,t])}function s(t){let e;return e=t.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof t.components?t.components(a):t.components||a:o(t.components),n.createElement(r.Provider,{value:e},t.children)}}}]);
