QKE is a technique that leverages the power of quantum computing to\nestimate a kernel function that is difficult to compute classically. The\nestimated kernel is then used by a classical computer to train a support vector\nmachine (SVM) for classification tasks. The authors focus on neutral atom\nquantum computers because they allow for more freedom in arranging the atoms,\nwhich is essential for implementing the necessary gates for QKE. They present a\ngeneral method for deriving 1-qubit and 2-qubit gates from laser pulses, which\nare then used to construct a parameterized sequence for feature mapping on 3\nqubits. They show that this approach can be extended to N qubits, taking\nadvantage of the more flexible arrangement of atoms in neutral atom devices. The\nexperimental setup involves simulating the Pasqal Chadoq2 device, which allows\nfor planar arrangement of atoms. The authors generate a dataset of 40 training\nsamples and 20 test samples with 3 features and a separation gap of 0.1. They\nuse the Qiskit library to implement the feature mapping circuit and generate the\nsequences of pulses for QKE. The training and testing of the SVM are performed\non a classical computer using the estimated kernel matrices. The results show\nthat the proposed approach achieves a high accuracy of 75% on the test set,\ndespite the small size of the dataset and the low separation. The authors\ncompare the performance to a classical SVM with a radial basis function kernel\nand find that the quantum approach outperforms the classical approach. The\nauthors discuss the advantages of using neutral atom quantum computers for QKE.\nThe arbitrary arrangement of atoms allows for more direct connections between\nqubits, reducing the depth of the circuit and reducing the impact of\ndecoherence. They also highlight the exponential computational advantage of\nquantum feature kernels over classical kernel computation methods for\nhigh-dimensional feature spaces. Overall, the paper presents a gate-based\napproach to QKE using neutral atom quantum computers. The experimental results\ndemonstrate the potential of this approach for supervised classification tasks\nand highlight the advantages of neutral atom devices for implementing QKE\ncircuits. The paper provides a foundation for future research in the field of\nquantum machine learning and quantum computing."})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,o.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,r.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,r.jsx)(l,{...e})}):l(e)}},8453(e,t,a){a.d(t,{R:()=>s,x:()=>i});var n=a(6540);const r={},o=n.createContext(r);function s(e){const t=n.useContext(o);return n.useMemo(function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}},[t,e])}function i(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(r):e.components||r:s(e.components),n.createElement(o.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
