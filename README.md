Welcome to Apache Mahout!
===========
The goal of the Apache Mahoutâ„¢ project is to build an environment for quickly creating scalable, performant machine learning applications.

# Qumat

Qumat is a POC of a high level Python library for intefacing with multiple quantum computing backends. It is designed to be easy to use and to abstract the particularities of each backend, so that you may 'write once, run anywhere.' Like the Java of quantum computing, but Java is the new COBOL so we're trying to distance ourselves from that comparison :P

Check out [basic gates](docs/basic_gates.md) for a quick introduction to the basic gates. These are now supported across multiple quantum computing frameworks, including Qiskit, Cirq, and Braket.

## Getting started

To install dependencies, run the following:
```
pip install -U poetry
poetry install
```

## Roadmap

### Q2 2024
- [x] Transition of Classic to maintenance mode

### Q3 2024
- [ ] Integration of Qumat with hardened (tests, docs, CI/CD) Cirq, Qiskit, and Braket backends
- [ ] Initiation of kernel methods
- [x] Integration with Amazon Braket
- [x] [Public talk about Qumat](https://2024.fossy.us/schedule/presentation/265/)

### Q3 2024
- [ ] Development of distributed quantum solvers

### Q1 2025
- [x] [FOSDEM talk](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5298-introducing-qumat-an-apache-mahout-joint-/)
