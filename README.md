Welcome to Apache Mahout!
===========
The Apache Mahoutâ„¢ project's goal is to build an environment for quickly creating scalable performant machine learning applications.

For additional information about Mahout, visit the [Mahout Home Page](http://mahout.apache.org/)

####Setting up your Environment
Whether you are using Mahout's Shell, running command line jobs or using it as a library to build your own apps you'll need to setup several environment variables. Edit your environment in `~/.bash_profile` for Mac or `~/.bashrc` for many linux distributions. Add the following
```
export MAHOUT_HOME=/path/to/mahout
export MAHOUT_LOCAL=true # for running standalone on your dev machine, 
# unset MAHOUT_LOCAL for running on a cluster
```
You will need a `$JAVA_HOME`, and if you are running on Spark, you will also need `$SPARK_HOME`

####Using Mahout as a Library
Running any application that uses Mahout will require installing a binary or source version and setting the environment.
To compile from source:
* `mvn -DskipTests clean install`
* To run tests do `mvn test`
* To set up your IDE, do `mvn eclipse:eclipse` or `mvn idea:idea`

To use maven, add the appropriate setting to your pom.xml or build.sbt following the template below.
If you only need the math part of Mahout:
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.mahout</groupId>
    <artifactId>mahout-math</artifactId>
    <version>${mahout.version}</version>
</dependency>
```
In case you would like to use some of our integration tooling (e.g. for generating vectors from Lucene):
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.mahout</groupId>
    <artifactId>mahout-hdfs</artifactId>
    <version>${mahout.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

####Examples
For examples of how to use Mahout, see the examples directory located in `examples/bin`
