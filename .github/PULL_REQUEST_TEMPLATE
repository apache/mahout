### Purpose of PR:
Please give a short description of what this PR is for.


First, make sure you are opening this PR against the `develop` branch (not master).
Right beneath "Open PR" you will see `base fork: apache/mahout` dropdown, then `master` as a dropdown. Click that and select `develop` (or in some cases the name of the feature-branch you're working on).

### Important ToDos
Please mark each with an "x"
- [ ] Opening PR against `develop` NOT `master` (OR `feature-name` if this is part of an ongoing feature development).
- [ ] A JIRA ticket exists (if not, please create this first)[https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN/]
- [ ] Title of PR is "MAHOUT-XXXX Brief Description of Changes" where XXXX
is the JIRA number.
- [ ] Created unit tests where appropriate
- [ ] Added licenses correct on newly added files
- [ ] Assigned JIRA to self
- [ ] Added documentation in scala docs/java docs, (and website once that
is merged to dev)
- [ ] Successfully built and ran all unit tests, verified that all tests
pass locally.

If all of these things aren't complete, but you still feel it is
appropriate to open a PR, please add [WIP] after MAHOUT-XXXX before the
descriptions- e.g. "MAHOUT-XXXX [WIP] Description of Change"

Oh by the way, does this change break earlier versions?

Is this the beginning of a larger project for which a feature branch should be made?
