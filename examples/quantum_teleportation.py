# Example of implementing Quantum Teleportation using QuMat
from qumat import QuMat

# Initialize your QuMat quantum computer with the chosen backend

    "backend_name": "qiskit_simulator",

        "simulator_type": "qasm_simulator",
        "shots": 1,  # Set to 1 for teleportation
    },
}

quantum_computer = QuMat(backend_config)

# Create an empty circuit with 3 qubits: one for the state to be teleported,
# and two for entanglement
quantum_computer.create_empty_circuit(3)

# Step 1: Create entanglement between qubits 1 and 2
quantum_computer.apply_hadamard_gate(1)
quantum_computer.apply_cnot_gate(1, 2)

# Step 2: Prepare the state to be teleported on qubit 0
quantum_computer.apply_hadamard_gate(0)
quantum_computer.apply_pauli_z_gate(0)  # Simulating an arbitrary state

# Step 3: Perform Bell measurement on qubits 0 and 1
quantum_computer.apply_cnot_gate(0, 1)
quantum_computer.apply_hadamard_gate(0)

# Measure qubits 0 and 1
quantum_computer.circuit.measure([0, 1], [0, 1])

# Step 4: Communicate measurement results to the receiver

# In a real quantum teleportation scenario, you would send the measurement results
# (classical bits) to the receiver via a classical communication channel.

# Step 5: Apply gates based on the measurement results

# Receiver's side:
# Initialize a quantum computer with the same backend

# Apply X and Z gates based on the received measurement results

if received_measurement_results[0] == 1:
    receiver_quantum_computer.apply_pauli_z_gate(2)

# The state on qubit 2 now matches the original state on qubit 0

# Step 6: Measure the received state (optional)

# Execute the quantum circuits and get the measurement results
