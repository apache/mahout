/**
  * Wraps a [[org.apache.mahout.sparkbindings.drm.DrmLike]] object with two [[com.google.common.collect.BiMap]]s to store ID/label translation dictionaries.
  * The purpose of this class is to wrap a DrmLike[C] with bidirectional ID mappings so
  * a user specified label or ID can be stored and mapped to and from the [[scala.Int]] ordinal ID
  * used internal to Mahout Core code.
  *
  * Example: For a transpose job the [[org.apache.mahout.drivers.IndexedDataset#matrix]]: [[org.apache.mahout.sparkbindings.drm.DrmLike]] is passed into the DSL code
  * that transposes the values, then a resulting [[org.apache.mahout.drivers.IndexedDataset]] is created from the transposed DrmLike object with swapped dictionaries (since the rows and columns are transposed). The new
  * [[org.apache.mahout.drivers.IndexedDataset]] is returned.
  *
  * @param matrix  DrmLike[Int], representing the distributed matrix storing the actual data.
  * @param rowIDs BiMap[String, Int] storing a bidirectional mapping of external String ID to
  *                  and from the ordinal Mahout Int ID. This one holds row labels
  * @param columnIDs BiMap[String, Int] storing a bidirectional mapping of external String
  *                  ID to and from the ordinal Mahout Int ID. This one holds column labels
  * @todo Often no need for both or perhaps either dictionary, so save resources by allowing
  *       to be not created when not needed.
