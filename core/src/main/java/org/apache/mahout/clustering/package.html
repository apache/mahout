This package provides several clustering algorithm implementations. Clustering usually groups a set of objects into groups
of similar items. The definition of similarity usually is up to you - for text documents, cosine-distance/-similarity is
recommended. Mahout also features other types of distance measure like Euclidean distance.
<br>
Input of each clustering algorithm is a set of vectors representing your items. For texts in general these are
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TFIDF">TFIDF</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag_of_words">Bag of words</a>
representations of the documents.
<br>
Output of each clustering algorithm is either a hard or soft assigment of items to clusters.
