This paper discusses the potential of large language models (LLMs), specifically
generative pretrained transformers (GPTs), in the field of quantum computing.
The authors propose a Quantum GPT-Guided Architecture Search (QGAS) model that
utilizes GPT-4 to recommend high-quality ansatz architectures for variational
quantum algorithms (VQAs). The ansatz architecture is a crucial component of
quantum computing and determines the efficiency and accuracy of quantum
algorithms. The authors conduct experiments using a series of application
benchmarks, including portfolio optimization, the MaxCut problem, the Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP), and the estimation of molecule ground state energy for
Lithium Hydride (LiH) and Water (H2O). They compare the performance of the
ansatz architectures generated by QGAS with existing ansatzes and
state-of-the-art ansatz architecture search methods. The results show that QGAS
outperforms other ansatz architectures in some benchmark applications,
demonstrating the potential of LLMs in quantum architecture design. The authors
highlight the importance of human feedback in guiding the performance of GPT-4.
Human experts provide specific guidance and feedback to improve the search
strategies and evaluate the generated ansatz architectures. The iterative
feedback loop between human experts and GPT-4 leads to better performance and
optimization of the quantum circuits. The paper also discusses the limitations
of GPT in the field of quantum computing. GPT is not a general artificial
intelligence and cannot think dynamically about quantum physics or make accurate
predictions about scientific phenomena in quantum experiments. It also relies on
large-scale data models, which may contain biased or misleading information
about quantum computing. The authors suggest future directions for the
integration of LLMs, such as GPT, in quantum computing. They propose that GPT
can be used to design and optimize fault-tolerant quantum algorithms and assist
in the calibration of quantum hardware. They also envision GPT playing a role in
the simulation of quantum computers and providing agile validation of
algorithmic innovations. In conclusion, this paper highlights the potential of
LLMs, specifically GPT, in the field of quantum computing. The QGAS model
demonstrates the effectiveness of using GPT-4 to generate high-performance
ansatz architectures for quantum algorithms. The integration of human feedback
and the power of GPT-4 provides a promising avenue for advancing quantum
architecture design and optimization. However, the limitations of GPT and the
challenges of applying LLMs to quantum computing should be considered. The
authors suggest further research and development to leverage the capabilities of
GPT and address the limitations to fully harness the potential of LLMs in
quantum computing.
