# Ignore all synced content from /docs/
# Only website-only directories are tracked here
#
# The sync script (scripts/sync-docs.js) copies documentation from /docs/
# into this directory. That synced content should NOT be tracked in git
# since /docs/ is the source of truth.
#
# Website-only content (community, about, download) is authored directly
# here and SHOULD be tracked.
