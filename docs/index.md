# QuMat

QuMat is a POC of a high level Python library for intefacing with multiple
quantum computing backends. It is designed to be easy to use and to abstract
the particularities of each backend, so that you may 'write once, run
anywhere.' Like the Java of quantum computing, but Java is the new COBOL so
we're trying to distance ourselves from that comparison :P

Check out [basic gates](basic_gates.md) for a quick introduction to the
basic gates which are basically all that exist right now (and even those
only exist for `qiskit`).

You can also check out examples in the [examples](examples) directory. The
cool one is [quantum teleportation](examples/quantum_teleportation.py).
