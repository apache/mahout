Oh happy day! A lot of work went into this release with getting the build system to work again so that we can release
binaries. There really weren't too many new features over 14.0, but binaries now exist in Maven.

On another note, we had a really exciting "MahoutCon" track at ApacheCon@home this year. A special thanks to all of our
speakers, and we plan to post the videos here when we're able.
