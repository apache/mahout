# Apache Zeppelin Quickstart

Apache Mahout is for Mathematicians (or statisticians, or data scientists, etc.).  We understand not all users
are up to cloning and building from source, working with command line interfaces, and other such engineering
tasks.

In that thread, we've created [The Apache Zeppelin Quickstart Docker Container](http://mahout.apache.org/docs/latest/tutorials/misc/getting-started-with-zeppelin/).

We hope this will make it easier for users to dip their toes in the Mahout waters. Let us know what you think on

* user at mahout dot apache dot org
* dev at mahout dot apache dot org

As always, we're looking for users to get involved, and encourage any patches to be submitted to: https://github.com/apache/mahout

Thanks, and good Mahout-ing!
